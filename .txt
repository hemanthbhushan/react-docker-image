to build the image cmd => docker build -t react-image
------------------------------------
remove the container :  docker rm react-container
---------------------------------------
know the running cointainer : docker ps
----------------------------
stop the cointainer : docker stop cointainer name 
-------------------------------------------
start the docker :  docker run --rm --name react-container -d -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app react-image

The command you've provided is a Docker command used to run a container based on a Docker image for a React application. Let's break down the command step by step:

docker run: This is the command to run a Docker container.

--rm: This flag indicates that the container should be removed automatically when it stops running. This is useful for cleaning up containers that are no longer in use.

--name react-container: This flag assigns a name to the container, in this case, "react-container." This name can be used to refer to the container in other Docker commands.

-d: This flag runs the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background without attaching to your terminal. This is typical for long-running processes like web servers.

-p 3000:3000: This flag maps port 3000 from the host machine to port 3000 inside the container. This is necessary because many React applications run a development server on port 3000 by default, and this flag allows you to access the application in your web browser.

-v $(pwd):/app: This flag mounts a volume from the host machine to the /app directory inside the container. It uses the $(pwd) command substitution to get the current working directory on the host machine. This is a common practice for development to allow the container to 
access and reflect changes made in the source code on your host machine. Changes made to files in the current directory on your host machine will be reflected in the /app directory within the container.

react-image: This is the name of the Docker image that you're running in the container. Presumably, this image contains the necessary dependencies to run a React application.

to check the past and current  logs we use :docker logs (cointainer hash) => docker logs -f 8c05029925b9
